# dietevolution_simulation

Goals:
-Simulate the determination of diet in siphonophores
-Compare the effects of different numbers of organismal determinants of diet
-Compare the effects of different evolutionary histories of the organismal determinants of diet
-Explore the information (general and evolutionary) contained in the unexplained variance of the diet 
  (not explained by measured determinants or measured prey-availability)


Real phylogenetic tree for Siphonophora
Different numbers of “measured” and “unmeasured” traits simulated on the tree. 
Selectivity indices determined for each prey type and species as a product of the deviations of different subsets of those traits. 
Relative availabilities of prey items per species generated at random. 
Diet calculated as the product of preyfield and selectivity.
